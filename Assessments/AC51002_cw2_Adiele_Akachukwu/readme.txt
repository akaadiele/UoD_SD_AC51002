Assignment Tasks
    Design and implement an application to simulate a Banking Application (give your Bank a unique
    name) that manages savings accounts, current accounts (and optionally, mortgages). 
    Your program should include at least the following:

    1. Define the classes to store and manage the data for your Banking Application
    
    2. Provide a Menu to run your Banking application.
    
    3. Provide an option to register a new Customer (choose suitable data to store for each customer).
    
    4. Provide options to open current accounts and saving accounts.
    
    5. Provide an option to show the current state of all accounts for a customer.
    
    6. Add an option to apply interest to all accounts.
    
    7. For each account type, provide options to enable a customer to view their account balance,
        deposit cash and withdraw cash.
    
    8. Save the current state of the Bank to a text file.
    
    9. Load the current state of the Bank from a text file, i.e. restore the current state of the Bank.
    
    10. Make good use of classes and functions in your design, to minimize code duplication and
        enhance the clarity and maintainability of code.

    11. Comment your program appropriately.

    12. Make your program robust to user input errors and display appropriate messages to the user.

When you have completed the core requirements, please consider adding some optional extra
    features (for extra marks up to a maximum of 15%). 
    For example:
        1. Add an option for a customer to open a mortgage account, with interest deducted (when
            interest is applied to savings accounts) and a monthly capital repayment amount which
            should be deducted from the current account.
    
        2. Include separate sub-Menus for Banking Admin and Customers.
    
        3. Any other features you think would improve your Banking simulation

Deliverables

    Please submit the following items in a single zip file:
    1. A single Report containing:
    a. Your class design which should contain a definition of the classes, the attributes and
    methods in your design, and shows how the classes interact.
    b. A test report showing what data you tested your program with and the actual results
    obtained.
    c. A short self-reflection on what requirements you implemented and any you didn’t (note
    partially implemented requirements if appropriate), and details on anything you found
    difficult or any aspects you are particularly pleased with such as any optional extras.
    2. Your Python source code files.
